# EventWindow: a web app for event management

This project is abandoned for now. Feel free to make use of the UI components! (The scheduler in particular, I'm pretty proud of it.)

EventWindow is an open-source web app designed to help small and non-profit organizations host events (like meetings, lectures, and classes), by providing a system for scheduling events, assigning and managing resources for those events, and visualizing the needs of upcoming events as they approach in time.
 
# What is it exactly?
 
EventWindow is an event sceduling application designed to be easily customized and embedded into existing company intranets or webpages. It consists of two central components: an event visualizer, which displays information about upcoming events in several different views (currently under development) and an event information page, unique to each event, which is used to create, edit, and approve events and their required resources, such as catering, parking spaces, or A/V equipment.
