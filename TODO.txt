TODO:

- stick in second fullcalendar
- modify fc options to format properly
- modify fc css for nice looking.

- begin writing onload ajax call for event data
- once ajax call works, begin writing mongodb schema for event object - fill it with all the attributes you wrote out in gdocs.
- once db populates list and calendars on load, work out livereload - how can we tell if resource has changed?
(do we need express to get involved, or does http protocol handle this somehow with 304s?)

- THEN, once we know the plumbing works, we fix the styling. Dropdown boxes in list, clickable items in calendar, and, the big one...
preview side-scroller. hooo boy how are we going to do that, by the way? A third calendar? no man no there's got to be a way to mirror
the element in a zoomed out way...... 0r render the calendar again, it may not be as computationally difficult as you think. Plus,
there may be a way to cut out the chaff... after all, we just need a visual representation, not the actual calendar's functionality.
This could be a fun problem - and defo something to keep a hold of if you nail it.

- anyway THEN using the new style resources get started on the EVENT PAGE. KEEP MODULARITY IN MIND SON.
